# Color the shell

Just a simple colouring script for fun! Works on both powershell and cmd. Either run from same directory or add the script to PATH.    

**Usage**: colors {colorname} {String}

## Example:
- colors green Hello
- colors skyblue "Hello, World"

You might need `./` prefixed before `colors` to make it work in Powershell
