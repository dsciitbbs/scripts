# Powershell

This is a simple script to show that while not as versatile as Bash, Powershell is pretty cool and customizable too. Using this, we can create a cool custom greetings screen on startup.

This uses the **OpenWeatherMapAPI**, so you would need to get a key from there. Many other services can be similarly integrated to customize your shell environment :smile:

**Note**: Place this folder under the existing scripts folder of PowerShell to make it work. You can find the location by running the command ```$PSScriptRoot```

Now, as it is in the image: *Happy Scripting*
